# Camera Setup Tips for Best Motion Tracking

To get the best performance from the activity tracking feature, follow these camera setup tips:

## Ideal Positioning

- **Distance**: Position yourself 5-8 feet (1.5-2.4 meters) away from the camera
- **Height**: The camera should be at roughly chest height
- **Angle**: Camera should be straight-on, not looking up or down at a steep angle
- **Full Body**: Ensure your whole body (head to feet) is visible in the frame

## Lighting Recommendations

- **Bright, Even Lighting**: Room should be well-lit with minimal shadows
- **Avoid Backlighting**: Don't stand with bright windows or lights behind you
- **Avoid Direct Glare**: Don't point camera directly at bright light sources
- **Indoor Lighting**: Standard indoor lighting is usually sufficient

## Background Suggestions

- **Solid Background**: A plain wall works best
- **Contrasting Colors**: Wear clothes that contrast with your background
- **Clutter-Free**: Remove objects from the area where you'll be moving
- **No Moving Objects**: Other moving people or objects can confuse the tracking

## Device Placement

- **Stable Surface**: Place your device on a stable surface or use a tripod
- **Landscape Orientation**: For tablets/phones, landscape mode works best
- **Webcam Positioning**: Ensure your webcam is securely positioned
- **Test Before Starting**: Do a quick camera check before beginning an activity

## Clothing Tips

- **Contrasting Colors**: Wear clothes that stand out from your background
- **Form-Fitting**: Loose, flowing clothing can confuse the pose detection
- **Full Visibility**: Make sure your limbs are clearly visible
- **No Camouflage**: Avoid wearing colors that match your background

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing detection issues:
1. Make sure there's enough light in the room
2. Check that your full body is visible in the frame
3. Try wearing different colored clothing
4. Move any distracting objects from the background
5. Restart the activity if issues persist

Following these guidelines will help ensure the motion tracking works optimally and provides accurate feedback during your activities!
