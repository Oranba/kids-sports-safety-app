# Activity Tracking Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Activity Tracking feature allows users to start and track activity sessions with camera-based motion tracking. This document outlines the implementation details and testing steps.

## Components Implemented

### 1. ActivitySelectionPage
- Displays available activity types (freestyle, dance, sports practice)
- Enhanced UI with activity details, difficulty level, and estimated points
- Visual appeal with emojis and kid-friendly design
- Quick access to start different activity types

### 2. ActivityPage
- Camera interface for motion capture
- Real-time activity tracking with motion feedback
- Timer for session duration
- Start/stop recording controls
- Achievements for activity milestones
- Visual feedback on user performance

### 3. MotionFeedback Component
- Analyzes pose data to assess activity level
- Provides real-time visual feedback on movement intensity
- Awards points for continued activity
- Kid-friendly encouragement messages

### 4. Camera Component Enhancements
- Added recording indicator for better user experience
- Improved loading animations
- Better error handling for camera issues
- Visual overlays for pose tracking

## Feature Flow
1. User navigates to activity selection page
2. User selects an activity type
3. Camera initializes and motion tracking begins
4. User performs activity while receiving feedback
5. Points are awarded based on activity level
6. User can stop the session and view results

## Testing Steps

### Home Page Quick Actions
- Check the new quick access buttons on the homepage
- Verify navigation to freestyle, dance, and activity selection

### Activity Selection
- Navigate to `/activities/new`
- Verify all activity cards display correctly
- Check that activity details are visible
- Test navigation to specific activity types

### Activity Recording
- Select an activity type
- Allow camera access when prompted
- Check that the camera initializes properly
- Test the "Start Recording" button
- Verify that motion tracking begins
- Check that the recording indicator appears
- Test that movement generates feedback
- Verify point accumulation works
- Test the "Stop Recording" button
- Verify completion screen displays correctly

### Motion Feedback
- Verify that movement is detected correctly
- Check that the activity level indicator responds to movement
- Test that feedback messages change based on activity level
- Verify points are awarded for continued activity

## Known Limitations
- Basic pose detection without specific activity recognition
- Limited feedback specificity
- Camera may need good lighting for best results

## Future Enhancements
- Activity-specific pose detection
- More granular feedback on specific movements
- Additional activity types
- Integration with external motion sensors
- Multiplayer/social activities
